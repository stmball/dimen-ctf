Your mission begins with a dataset containing gene expression levels from two different experimental conditions: \"Treatment A\" and \"Control.\" Your goal is to identify genes that exhibit significant differential expression between these conditions. Columns \"Sample_0\" through to \"Sample_4\" are controls, and \"Sample_5\" to \"Sample_9\" are treatment samples.</p>\n<p>Using whatever method works for you, download the <code class=\"language-text\">csv</code> file below and find the top 5 genes that are differentially expressed the most (have the highest log fold change).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stmball/dimen-ctf/main/question_generation/expression_expedition_data.csv\">Download the dataset</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Expression Expedition","date":null,"description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Stressful Surveys/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stressful Surveys"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Wicked Westerns/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Wicked Westerns"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2d978f39-f2e4-5625-8226-4077e817b912","previousPostId":"c4588046-f5a8-56fb-a7f6-f2708b95332d","nextPostId":"edac19d4-9db2-51e9-8a3e-b5d959db5020"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3274528899"],"slicesMap":{}}
