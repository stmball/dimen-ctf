# dimen-ctf - A CTF-style challenge for DiMeN PhD students for data analysis.

## Development

This site runs using an edited version of ![https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog](Gatsby Starter Blog) with a few changes to the theme and the content.

To run the site locally, clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
npm run develop
```

Questions can be found in the `content/blog` - each question has a corresponding function in `quesiton_generation` that is used to generate the question and solution for the problem.

## TODOs:
