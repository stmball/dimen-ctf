You are a researcher studying the effect of exercise on monkeys. You have two groups of monkeys - one that has been given access to an outdoor gym area and one that hasn't. In the dataset below, you are given the lean muscle mass of each monkey in each group.

Do the monkeys that have access to the gym have more lean muscle mass than those that don't? Provide a p-value from the appropriate test.
