title: Performance Pulse
points: 100

You are conducting an experiment with drivers, measuring their pulse rate at different speeds. You have the pulse rates of 100 drivers at different speeds. You need to create a linear regression model for testing if speed has an effect on heart rate, and provide the p-value of the speed coefficient.
