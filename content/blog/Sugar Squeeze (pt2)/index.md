title: Sugar Squeeze (Part 2)
points: 100
---
You are conducting another study on health inequalities - you've recorded the weights (in kg) of 100 people as split by the daily amount of sugar they consume - but this time you have 5 groups _each_ for the amount of fructose and the amount of sucrose they consume, totaling 25 groups. This time, find if there is a significant effect on weight for the amount of sucrose, fructose, or the combination of the two on weights.
