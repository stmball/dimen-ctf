You are conducting a study on health inequalities - you've recorded the weights (in kg) of 100 people as split by the daily amount of sugar they consume, split into 5 groups. Is there any evidence to suggest that sugar consumption has an effect of weight? You will need to submit the p-value from the appropriate statistical test.
