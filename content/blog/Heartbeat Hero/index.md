You are a cardiologist with a clinic full of patients, one of which you think has [Long QT Syndrome](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/long-qt-syndrome). For each patient, you have a list of their cardiac events (PQRST) and how long they spend in each one.

```csv
P,34.2
Q,22.1
R,45.6
S,12.3
T,34.5
P,34.3
...etc
```

You need to find the patient with the longest average QT interval.
