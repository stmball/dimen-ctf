You have a master's student who is conducting a simple t-test comparing two groups you know to be different, however no matter what the student does, they always get strange p-values. You remember that a t-test requires the assumption of normality of the samples - so you get one of the groups to perform the correct statistical test to see if the test is appropriate. Given the dataset, find the p-value of the correct normality test.
