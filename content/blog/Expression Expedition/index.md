You are a bioinformatics sleuth tasked with uncovering the mysteries of gene expression in a groundbreaking study. Your mission begins with a dataset containing gene expression levels from two different experimental conditions: "Treatment A" and "Control." Your goal is to identify genes that exhibit significant differential expression between these conditions.

Using whatever method works for you, download the `csv` file below and find the top 5 genes that are differentially expressed the most (have the highest log fold change).
